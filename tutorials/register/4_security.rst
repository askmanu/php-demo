Security Considerations in User Registration
============================================

When implementing user registration in a Symfony application, security must be a primary concern. The La Boot'ique application implements several security features to protect user data and prevent common vulnerabilities.

Password Security
-----------------

The registration system employs Symfony's ``UserPasswordHasherInterface`` to securely hash passwords before storing them in the database:

.. code-block:: php

   $user->setPassword($userPasswordHasher->hashPassword($user, $form->get('password')->getData()));

This approach ensures that plain-text passwords are never stored in the database. Instead, only cryptographically secure hashes are persisted, protecting user credentials even in the event of a database breach.

The password field in the registration form uses Symfony's ``RepeatedType``, requiring users to enter their password twice to prevent typos:

.. code-block:: php

   ->add('password', RepeatedType::class, [
       'type' => PasswordType::class,
       'invalid_message' => 'Les mots de passe doivent être identiques',
       // ...
   ])

Additionally, password strength is enforced through validation constraints:

.. code-block:: php

   new Length([
       'min' => 4,
       'minMessage' => 'Votre mot de passe doit contenir minimum 8 charactères',
       'max' => 4096,
   ])

Input Validation
----------------

The application implements comprehensive input validation to prevent malicious data entry:

1. **Email validation**: Uses Symfony's ``Email`` constraint to ensure properly formatted email addresses
2. **Length constraints**: Enforces minimum length requirements for names (3 characters)
3. **Unique email**: The ``UniqueEntity`` constraint on the User entity prevents duplicate accounts

.. code-block:: php

   #[UniqueEntity('email', "Cet email est déja pris")]

Protection Against Common Vulnerabilities
-----------------------------------------

The registration system protects against several common security vulnerabilities:

1. **SQL Injection**: By using Doctrine's ORM and parameterized queries, the application is inherently protected against SQL injection attacks
2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Symfony forms include CSRF protection by default
3. **Session Fixation**: Upon successful registration, the user is authenticated with a new session

Security Interface Implementation
---------------------------------

The User entity implements Symfony's security interfaces:

.. code-block:: php

   class User implements UserInterface, PasswordAuthenticatedUserInterface

These interfaces ensure proper integration with Symfony's security system, providing standardized methods for authentication, password management, and role-based access control.

By implementing these security measures, the registration system provides a robust foundation for user account creation while protecting against common security threats.
