Cart Data Structure and Management
=================================

In e-commerce applications, the shopping cart is a fundamental component that allows users to collect products before purchasing. Let's explore how carts are structured and managed in code.

Session-Based Storage
---------------------

Most e-commerce platforms, including the La Boot'ique example we're examining, store cart data in the user's session. This approach offers several advantages:

- Carts persist between page visits without requiring user login
- Data remains private to each user's browser session
- No database writes are needed until checkout, reducing server load

The cart implementation typically uses a service pattern, where a dedicated Cart class manages all cart-related operations while the controller handles HTTP requests and responses.

Cart Item Representation
------------------------

Cart items are typically represented as a collection of product references and quantities. In our example system:

- Each cart item stores a product ID and quantity
- The cart service retrieves full product details when needed
- Additional metadata like added date might be tracked

For example, a simplified cart data structure might look like this in PHP::

    [
        'products' => [
            [
                'product' => Product object,
                'quantity' => 2
            ],
            [
                'product' => Product object,
                'quantity' => 1
            ]
        ],
        'totals' => [
            'quantity' => 3,
            'price' => 129.97
        ]
    ]

Relationship Between Products and Cart Items
--------------------------------------------

The relationship between products and cart items is a crucial aspect of cart design:

- Products are persistent entities stored in the database
- Cart items are temporary references to products with additional information
- When displaying the cart, the system fetches current product information (name, price, etc.)
- This design ensures users always see up-to-date product information

This separation allows the cart to remain lightweight while still providing all necessary information for the shopping experience. When a user proceeds to checkout, the cart data transforms into a more permanent Order entity with OrderDetails that capture the product information at the time of purchase.
