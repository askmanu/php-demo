Payment Integration and Processing
================================

Integrating payment gateways is a critical component of any e-commerce system. This section explores how payment processing works in an online store, with a focus on Stripe integration.

Understanding Payment Gateways
------------------------------

Payment gateways serve as intermediaries between your e-commerce platform and financial institutions. They securely process customer payment information and authorize transactions. In our example application, Stripe is used as the payment gateway of choice.

The integration process typically involves:

- Creating a developer account with the payment provider
- Installing the payment gateway's SDK or library
- Configuring API keys and webhook endpoints
- Implementing the payment flow in your application

Stripe Integration
------------------

Looking at our e-commerce application, we can see that the ``Order`` entity includes a ``stripeSession`` property::

    #[ORM\Column(type: 'string', length: 255, nullable: true)]
    private $stripeSession;

This field stores a unique session identifier generated by Stripe when a payment is initiated. The session ID links the order in our system to the payment process handled by Stripe.

When a customer proceeds to checkout, the application:

1. Creates an order record in the database
2. Initializes a Stripe payment session
3. Redirects the customer to Stripe's payment interface or embeds it directly in the page
4. Waits for the payment process to complete

Handling Payment Callbacks
--------------------------

After a customer completes (or abandons) the payment process, Stripe notifies our application through webhooks. These are HTTP callbacks that Stripe sends to a predefined endpoint in our application.

A typical webhook handler would:

1. Verify the webhook signature to ensure it's legitimate
2. Identify the corresponding order using the session ID
3. Update the order status based on the payment result
4. Trigger any follow-up actions (sending confirmation emails, updating inventory, etc.)

Updating Order Status
---------------------

The ``Order`` entity includes a ``state`` property that tracks the order's status throughout its lifecycle::

    #[ORM\Column(type: 'integer')]
    private $state;

When a payment is successful, the webhook handler updates this state to indicate that payment has been received. The ``OrderRepository`` includes a method specifically for finding paid orders::

    public function findPaidOrdersByUser($user)
    {
        return $this->createQueryBuilder('o')
            ->andWhere('o.state > :val')
            ->andWhere('o.user = :user')
            ->setParameter('val', 0)
            ->setParameter('user', $user)
            ->orderBy('o.createdAt', 'DESC')
            ->getQuery()
            ->getResult()
        ;
    }

This suggests that orders with a state greater than 0 are considered paid, allowing the application to filter and display orders appropriately in the user interface.

Security Considerations
-----------------------

When implementing payment processing, security is paramount. Best practices include:

- Never storing full credit card details in your database
- Using HTTPS for all payment-related communications
- Implementing proper authentication for webhook endpoints
- Following PCI DSS compliance guidelines
- Regularly updating payment gateway libraries and dependencies

By properly integrating payment gateways and handling the payment flow securely, an e-commerce application can provide a smooth checkout experience while maintaining the security of customer payment information.
