/**
* This file contains the CartController for the La Boot'ique e-commerce platform, which manages all shopping cart functionality. 
* 
* The controller provides endpoints for viewing the cart contents, adding products, decreasing item quantities, removing specific items, and emptying the entire cart. 
* 
* It leverages Symfony's routing system with French-language URLs and works with a Cart service that handles the underlying business logic. 
* 
* The controller renders cart information to users, including product details, total quantity, and total price, through a Twig template. 
* 
* This component is essential for the e-commerce platform's shopping experience, allowing customers to manage their selected products before proceeding to checkout.
